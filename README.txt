Project ScoutThis project combines my experience with obstacle avoidance, with my new interest in multi-robot communication. The objective of this project involves a scout robot using my N.O.M.A.D algorithm to solve a maze. While finding its way out of the maze, the "scout" robot "tells" a "blind" robot, not outfitted with sensors, how to get out of the maze based on its experience. The end result is two robots solving a maze while doing half the work.Blog Posts: http://www.ericsmalls.com/search/label/Project%20ScoutVideos: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30EEEB5BFAA36EECMulti-Robot Lessons: http://www.robotc.net/firewiki/index.php?title=Main_Page
